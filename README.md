# This project is archived. I decided to not continue working on it. All code is FOSS so you can take it and host your own servers. Also possible to configure your own server in the webextension. Thanks for all the years


## Unshort.link

[ðŸ’µ Please consider supporting this project to keep it up and running ðŸ’µ](https://gum.co/unshortlink)


Prevent short link services from tracking you by un shortening the urls for your. Try it on [unshort.link](https://unshort.link)

## Features

- Access short links for you to prevent the short link providers to track you
- Check links against a blacklist to prevent access to a harmful website hidden behind a short link
- Remove known tracking parameters from the urls behind the short links (e.g. the facebook tracking parameter `utm_source`)
- Remove as many url parameters as possible by keeping the same website result. This helps to remove tracking parameters that are so far unknown
