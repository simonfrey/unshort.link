# Unshort.link
Prevent short link services from tracking you by un shortening the urls for your. Try it on [unshort.link](https://unshort.link)

## Features

- Access short links for you to prevent the short link providers to track you
- Check links against a blacklist to prevent access to a harmful website hidden behind a short link
- Remove known tracking parameters from the urls behind the short links (e.g. the facebook tracking parameter `utm_source`)
- Remove as many url parameters as possible by keeping the same website result. This helps to remove tracking parameters that are so far unknown
